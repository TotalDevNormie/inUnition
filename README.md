InUnition is a note taking app for the web and mobile devices. It allows users to create, edit, and delete notes, as well as organize them by tags.

The app is built with Laravel for the backend API and Expo/React Native for the frontend. It uses a SqLite database for storing notes and their associated data.

As of now it is in development.
